# George Paul 

I am a data scientist with a strong academic background and hands-on industry experience. I hold an MSc in Data Science from the University of Bath and a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Manchester. My work combines statistical thinking with creative problem-solving to build impactful models in real-world contexts.

This portfolio highlights selected projects that demonstrate my ability to deliver results across a range of technical challenges ‚Äî from Bayesian modelling and reinforcement learning to metric design and data engineering.
